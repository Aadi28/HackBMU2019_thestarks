# Problem Satement

A WHO report released in 2016, had claimed that 31 per cent of those who claimed to be allopathic doctors in 2001 were educated only up to the secondary school level and 57 per cent did not have any medical qualification.
This poses a serious threat.  number of people every year lose their lives because of negligence. 

Also, in India, according to WHO, less than 5% of medical data from patients is being collected in India, in contrast to industrialised nations where hospitals are mandated to collect and register all relevant medical history about their patients. 
“In India, only 400 out of the 62,000 hospitals collect medically relevant information about their patients,” said Dr Nagendra Swamy of Manipal Hospitals. “The only reason for this is that they are mandated by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals (NABH) to do so.”

# Our Solution

We aim to tackle both the problems by validating a doctor's certificate with the issuing authority. Once verified, the doctor will examine the patient, he will have access to the medical history of the patient maintained by our application. This will help in prescribing medicines much better.
After examination, the doctor can add prescription to the history database. If he wants to give a written prescription, the patient can scan the prescriprion slip and using OCR, the application will add the text to the database.

# Additional features

We provide with a google map-like interface which tells location of verified hospitals, blood banks, pharmacies and clinics around you.
You can view your medical history, from the time of birth (uploaded by the patient) till date.
Data analysis can be done on the data collected. Diseases along with their areas, time of spreading of a particular disease etc can be added which will help in tackling diseases altogether.
Prescriptions will be smarter.
